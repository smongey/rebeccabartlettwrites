					<h2>Galway Youth Theatre</h2>

					<p>Founder and first Artistic Director, Rebecca Co-wrote (with her friend Molly Foggarty) and directed a number of critically acclaimed plays for ensemble performance in Galway’s Arts Festival,  including ‘Don’t Forget To Write ‘ &amp;  Iron Horse Blues’</p>

					<blockquote>&lsquo;Quotations here from reviews of these plays&rsquo;</blockquote>

					<p>She also designed, developed, and implemented theatre-training programmes for Galway Youth Theatre members, including a professional training course in Theatrical Production and Design, which was the first of its kind in Ireland.

					<p>Under Rebecca’s Directorship GYT toured their plays to the Aran Island and to other Festivals in the west. One very memorable performance on midsummer’s evening in Coole Park was a performance of Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p>

					<h2>Director<br/>National Festival <br/>of Youth Theatre</h2>

					<p>Cliona&rsquo;s Wave at the Galway Arts Festival 1999, involved 90 youth theatre members aged 16–24 and a team of drama facilitators. Based on an ancient Irish myth the performance was the result of five days of intense workshop activity and months of planning.  It was performed at Galway’s famous Spanish Arch to an accumulated audience of 700 Festival-goers and holiday makers.</p>
					<blockquote>&amp;</blockquote>
					<p>Bards in the Yard performed in the grounds of Dublin Castle July 2003.</p>
					<p>In order to provide Youth Theatres with access to scripts that would not normally have been available to them, Rebecca was commissioned by the National Association for Youth Drama to research and gather scene extracts from plays in Ireland's theatrical past.</p>
					<p>In terms of their staging, these extracts offered a variety of theatrical styles and an opportunity to be imaginative in terms of artistic exploration and adventurous in presentation.</p>
					<p>This was a four-day theatrical event and played to an open-air audience of several hundred.</p>

					<h2>Beyond The Telling</h2>
					<p>Written and directed by Rebecca as part of The Scealta Shamhain  Festival, was performed at the National Museum of Ireland Collins’ Barracks.  Documented through real journeys, letters and trial evidence this theatrical performance was an adaptation of three of Rebecca’s own radio plays: Women of ‘98.  They had originally been commissioned and broadcast by RTE as part of their commemoration for the 1798 rebellion.</p>
					<p>The final script Beyond The Telling explores the social and emotional impact of the rebellion on the lives of the women left behind to cope with loneliness, poverty and often despair.</p>
